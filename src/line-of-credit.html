                    A line of credit gives you access to money any time you need it. You can draw on it up to your maximum limit for a set period of time and only pay interest when you borrow on the line of credit. Once you pay back borrowed funds,
                    that amount is again available for you to borrow. With this flexible borrowing option, you can choose when to take out the money, pay it back and borrow again, as long as you adhere to the terms as well as paying off what you
                    borrow on time and in full.
