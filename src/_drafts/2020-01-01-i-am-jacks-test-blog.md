# Gentlemen, welcome to Blog Club.




1. You do not talk about Blog Club.
2. **You do not talk about Blog Club.**
3. Someone yells "Stop!", goes limp, taps out, the Blog is over.
4. Only two writers to a Blog.
5. One blog at a time, fellas.
6. No shirts, no shoes.
7. Blogs will go on as long as they have to.
8. Final rule: If this is your first night at Blog Club, you have to Blog.
