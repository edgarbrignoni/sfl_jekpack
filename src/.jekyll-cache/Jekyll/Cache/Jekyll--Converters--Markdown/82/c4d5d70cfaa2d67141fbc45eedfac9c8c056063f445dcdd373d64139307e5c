I"¬<p>Ever since the financial crisis in 2008, millennials have had to come to grips with a new financial reality that previous generations have been spared from. As a result of the new financial climate change, millennials have spent the past decade learning how to cope with limited pay, soaring gas prices, and higher-than-ever living costs.</p>

<p>Many of which have even opted to stay with their parents rather than risk venturing out to make a life for themselves. Things have improved though. <strong>Young adults in their twenties and thirties are now finding a way to manage money</strong> by putting new budgeting exercises into practice that help them pay rent, save, and even pay down their student loans and installment loans.</p>

<p>How exactly are they doing it? It‚Äôs really not a complicated thing. Even something as perplexing as money can be boiled down to a very simple science with the right perspective. Here‚Äôs a glimpse of what millennials are doing today that‚Äôs allowing them to thrive under seemingly unbearable economic circumstances:</p>

<h2 id="theyre-spending-with-caution">They‚Äôre spending with caution</h2>
<h3 id="going-out-less">Going out less</h3>

<p>It‚Äôs true. Millennials are giving the phrase, ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù new meaning. Instead of literally going out to the bar, a sporting event, or a stadium-filled rock concert, millennials are becoming more conservatives with their weekend shindigs. That‚Äôs not to say that they‚Äôre never leaving the house. It‚Äôs more like a downsizing of activities. Here‚Äôs what we mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Instead of meeting at a bar or restaurant, they‚Äôll meet at each other‚Äôs homes.</li>
  <li>Instead of going out to the movies, they‚Äôll host a movie night.</li>
  <li>Instead of going to a game, they‚Äôll watch it on TV.</li>
</ul>

<p>It‚Äôs not the most lavish way to meet up, but you can bet that by keeping the weekend get-togethers low-key, millennials are saving a ton of money without sacrificing good company!</p>

<h2 id="minimalism-is-in">Minimalism is in</h2>

<p>Millennials also have adopted a new minimalist lifestyle that puts experiences at the forefront and material things on the backburner. They‚Äôre learning to stick with the few things that make them happy while letting go of what they can do without.</p>

<p>By keeping the clutter out of their lives, young adults are beginning to see things from a brand-new perspective. They‚Äôre quickly discovering that life does get easier and more enjoyable once all the material distractions are taken out of the picture.</p>

<p>Not only that, but they‚Äôre also saving big money by keeping their stash of stuff small. It‚Äôs not for everyone, but most who have given it a try claim to be much happier and wealthier too.</p>

<h2 id="theyre-exploring-alternative-ways-to-buy-goods">They‚Äôre exploring alternative ways to buy goods</h2>

<p>Thrift stores, small online marketplaces, and farmer‚Äôs markets have become shopping staples for a growing number of millennials. But it‚Äôs not what you think. There‚Äôs a lot more to this trend than just saving a few bucks.</p>

<p>Whether it‚Äôs out of some feeling of moral responsibility or a rebellion against greedy big suit types, younger generations are choosing to support smaller businesses rather than continuing to feed hungry corporate giants like Wal Mart or Target. Either way, millennials are saving a ton of money by giving it to smaller businesses.</p>

<h2 id="theyre-using-entertainment-thats-affordable">They‚Äôre using entertainment that‚Äôs affordable</h2>

<h3 id="staying-in">Staying in</h3>

<p>To millennials, going out is kind of overrated. That‚Äôs not to say they don‚Äôt take pleasure in getting out of the house every once in a while. They are human after all. And it‚Äôs not even that they‚Äôd rather be home than out at the bars and clubs.</p>

<p>The reason why more millennials are choosing to stay in ist that they know that it‚Äôs better for them. They‚Äôd rather stay in or go to a friend‚Äôs houses to hang out than to spend their hard-earned cash at some bar or club. Remember, a lot of millennials are still balancing work, school, and family day after day. That said, going out is just not a priority for them.</p>

<h2 id="online-subscription-services">Online subscription services</h2>

<p>Gone are the days of making it a Blockbuster night. With affordable online streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, millennials have access to the widest selection of movies, TV shows, and the like without ever having to leave the house! And it doesn‚Äôt stop there.</p>

<p>Online streaming services are available for just about everything else; audiobooks, music, video games, and even comics. And because these streaming services are fairly cheap, millennials can keep themselves entertained for as many hours as they want at the price of just one movie, game or record per month.</p>

<h2 id="theyre-taking-their-careers-into-their-own-hands">They‚Äôre taking their careers into their own hands</h2>

<h3 id="freelance">Freelance</h3>

<p>Freelancing is the new way to earn an income. Nowadays, people are getting laid off left and right and job security seems to be a thing of the past. So millennials are taking their careers into their own hands by seeking out contracted work and by relying on their own networking skills to create their own job security.</p>

<p>It sounds less stable than a rigid 9 to 5 office job, but it works. Many millennials today are able to earn a solid income doing just freelance and not having to work for the same boss for years on end seems to keep them more focused and motivated to keep at it.</p>

<h2 id="entrepreneurship">Entrepreneurship</h2>

<p>Since freelancing and working remotely have been growing career trends, entrepreneurship has taken a front-row seat in millennial‚Äôs careers too. It makes sense since we‚Äôre now able to design, produce, and share our own content over the internet. This makes the idea of working for yourself a viable option for anyone willing to do it. So even if the job market failed again, millennials wouldn‚Äôt really have a hard time finding ways to earn a living.</p>

<h2 id="theyre-spending-less-and-living-more">They‚Äôre spending less and living more</h2>

<p><strong>Ultimately, millennials are able to manage money well due to their simple choice to spend less and experience more.</strong> Experiences are what makes life enjoyable and they don‚Äôt always come at the price of an admission ticket. Experiencing the beach, time with friends, or even your own neighborhood costs nothing, and it‚Äôs worth a whole lot more than what one could spend on material things.</p>
