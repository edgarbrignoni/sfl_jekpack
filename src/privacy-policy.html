<h2>ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>Under certain circumstances, the CCPA allows a California resident access of his or her personal information by requesting disclosure of specific pieces of information, or by requesting identification of categories of personal information. Please note that the Company has listed the categories of personal information we maintain on consumers in our general business practice under the section entitled Notice of Collection above.

</p>

<h2>SALE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>
The Company does not and will not sell your personal information within the meaning of the CCPA.
