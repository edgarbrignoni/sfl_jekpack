## Huntsville, AL

When it comes to good, affordable living, the Heart of Dixie is right where you want to be, specifically, Huntsville. This little spot in northern Alabama offers affordable living and plenty of cultural attractions that’ll make you feel young again.

## Phoenix, AZ

When it comes to retirement, there are many things people want to check off their bucket list and you can bet seeing Grand Canyon is near the top of that list. Unbeknownst to many, the state of Arizona has a lot to offer retirees with gorgeous climate, beautiful natural scenery and an abundance of attractions and sites to see. It’s not the most affordable on the list, with average living costs surpassing the national average. Those who choose to live out their golden years here should expect to pay a higher than normal cost of living.

## Denver, CO

Placing 4th on the United Health Foundation's senior health rankings, Colorado has a very high reputation for promoting healthy living. In fact, the Milken Institute ranked Denver the 12th best big city for successful aging. This is mostly due in part by Denver’s healthy and active senior population. The city comes highly recommended for many aspects of its retiree infrastructure including public transit, highly-rated nursing homes and easy access to health care facilities.

## Cape Coral, FL

Florida is perhaps the king of retirement communities. With year-long summers, multiple retirement home communities, fairly priced living costs, and more than enough entertainment, it’s no wonder why so many choose Florida to live out their retirement years. Cape Coral's unique waterway access makes boating, fishing and water sports an easy pastime. But if water’s not your thing, there’s plenty of fun to be had on land too with nearby beaches, golf courses, beautiful parks, and more.

## Charleston, SC

With southern charm, rich history and a happy medium between city and country, Charleston offers retirees a place that’s truly unique and special. The area offers gorgeous scenery, plenty of amazing food places and even more things to do to burn off the comfort food calories.

Before considering any of these places for retirement, it’s important to make sure you have a solid retirement savings built up so you can actually enjoy these places, rather than just being able to afford bills and not much else.
